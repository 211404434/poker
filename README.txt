Various Experimental Poker Classes in Java
(C) Copyright 2008-2010 Daniel W. Dyer

This project contains some Java classes for modelling poker games and running
poker-related experiments.  It is very incomplete and not really useful for
anything in particular.  There are a couple of experiments included.  One
performs a Monte Carlo simulation of different Texas Hold'em starting hands to
see which ones are strongest.  The other uses the Watchmaker Framework
(http://watchmaker.uncommons.org) to run an evolutionary algorithm to find
cold decks (see http://www.benjoffe.com/holdem).  Perhaps the most useful
classes are the general purpose poker hand evaluators.  These are reasonably
efficient but there are faster implementations available elsewhere that will
perform better subject to certain constraints.
